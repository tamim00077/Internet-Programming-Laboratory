## Project Overview
This project is a basic web-based registration form system developed as part of the Internet Programming Laboratory course at my university. It demonstrates the implementation of fundamental web development concepts including HTML, CSS, and PHP form handling.

## Features
- User-friendly registration interface
- Input fields for:
  - Name
  - Email
  - ID
  - Phone number
  - Gender selection
  - City selection from major Bangladesh cities

- POST method for form submission

## Project Structure
```
├── registration.html    # Main registration form
├── displayinfo.php     # Form data display page
└── README.md          # Project documentation
```

## Installation and Setup
1. Ensure you have a web server with PHP support (e.g. XAMPP)
2. Clone this repository to your web server's root directory
3. Access the registration form through your web browser

```bash
# Example using XAMPP
git clone [your-repository-url]
# Place in htdocs folder
# Access via: localhost/[project-folder]/registration.html
```

## Usage
1. Open the registration form in a web browser
2. Fill in the required information:
   - Enter your name
   - Provide your email address
   - Input your ID number
   - Enter your phone number
   - Select your gender
